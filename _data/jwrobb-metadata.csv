Transcript: ""NEW ORLEANS, April 25—(AP)—Lieutenant James W. Robb, Jr., daring Navy pilot who disregarded all safety measures and went gunning for Japanese bombers at Pearl Harbor Dec. 7 in an amphibian plane armed only with a rifle, was awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism in ceremonies today at Eighth District Navy headquarters here. High praise was paid the pilot by Secretary Knox in an official citation and the award was presented here by Captain Frank T. Leighton, district commander, before his entire staff. Lieut. Robb, now an instructor at the Naval Air school, Corpus Christi, said he was proud to get the cross ""and I feel pretty good but it really is representative of all the boys out there. They deserve it as much as I do. I just happened to be the lucky one to get it.""","Clippings (Books, newspapers, etc.); Naval decorations",,,,"Private collection of Evan Robb, Olympia, Washington",,Image,image/jpeg,eng,In Copyright,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/
